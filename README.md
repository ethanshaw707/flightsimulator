# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}
This is a program of a Flight Simulator. We built this to learn about Rust, and learn more about the equations and the technical abilities required for coding in aviation. We have made a plane that is flying, and the user is able to simulate the flight. 


# Development Environment
Cargo Watch- We used this in order to live update the program, which was very helpful
Rust- Programming language designed for operating systems and game engines.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- We can improve on the physics of the plane, making the movement more airplane like
- We can improve on the scenary, making it more realistic.
- We can improve on the design of the code, making more files with a better structural design.
